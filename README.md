# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: This analysis aims to help the management of Pewlett-Hackard deal with the upcoming retirements.
###Results: Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables.
  - We learn from retiring titles tables that thousands of people are ready to retire soon, as seen here. ![alt text](https://github.com/samnougues/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/retiring%20titles.png)
  - The largest group that needs to be replaced is Senior Engineers, with 25,916 positions that need to be replaced. As seen in the previous photo.
  - The smallest group that needs to be replaced is Managers, with only two that need to be replaced.
  - There are about 1500 people with enough seniority to mentor, as seen here ![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samnougues/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/main/Mentors%20list.png)

###Summary: 
How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact? To answer this question, we need to create a query that sums up all the counts from the retiring table. As seen here with the answer which is 72,458 ![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samnougues/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/main/Sum%20on%20titles%20count.png)
Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees? To find the answer to this, we would do something similar to the previous question and find the count of all the people in the mentor eligibility. As seen here, ![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samnougues/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/main/mentorship%20count.png). Here you see there are only 1549 people who are eligible to mentor. That would mean every mentor would have approximately 47 mentees, which may be too much for them.
